# Entropic_LLMs
Repository on entropic large language models. Will hopefully add some ideas and stacks here. Currently only uploaded a quick Note on EBMs and entropic models. In an upcoming update I will add the full Note on varentropy-complexity and sparsity methods. A more theoretical generalization for EBMs will be added as well, mostly. 

I need to code example models too, but currently I have no fully working demos.
